Centric’s contact.
 Please include some meaningful tests for your code.
 Ideally, we would like to see both unit tests and functional tests at the api
level.
 Do not comment on the obvious but feel free to add comments that adds
value to the reader.
 Provide a short README that gives the instructions to compile and run
your sample.
 Feel free to use an in-memory database like H2 if you wish.
